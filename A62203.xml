            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>WHen sullen Darkness had o'er-spread the face</l>
               <l>O'th Universe, when th'Sun had ceas'd to grace</l>
               <l>The spacious Earth with his Illustrious Beams,</l>
               <l>And dipt his Golden Head i'th western streams;</l>
               <l>VVhen every Mortal was dispos'd to rest,</l>
               <l>And anxious care was banish'd from each breast:</l>
               <l>Tir'd with the Labours of the fore-past day,</l>
               <l>Each one to sweet Repose makes hast away.</l>
               <l>VVhen pleasant sleep had clos'd up ev'ry eye,</l>
               <l>And ev'ry honest man did slumbering lye:</l>
               <l>When none but Tories stagger'd up and down,</l>
               <l>And Bullies, to disturb our peaceful Town.</l>
               <l>Like Owls and Batts they shun the hated Light,</l>
               <l>To act their deeds of darkness in the Night.</l>
               <l>Then did begin this Pleasant Comedie,</l>
               <l>VVich prov'd to th' Actor almost a Tragedie;</l>
               <l>As by the Sequel, you will plainly see.</l>
               <l>The envious Tories with the Devil combin'd,</l>
               <l>T' asperse that noble Lord, who lately shin'd</l>
               <l>As a bright Star, in our terrestial Sphear,</l>
               <l>Alas too glorious to continue here</l>
               <l>Longer amongst poor Mortals; but he's gon</l>
               <l>To joyn in Consort, with the Heavenly throng:</l>
               <l>Where he enjoys eternal peace and rest,</l>
               <l>And with Felicitie's, for ever blest:</l>
               <l>Above the reach of the malicious hate</l>
               <l>Of wicked Tories, and of cruel fate</l>
               <l>That would allow to's Life no longer date.</l>
               <l>But now the scene begins, O horrid sight!</l>
               <l>A dreadful Ghost appears, drest all in white:</l>
               <l>Enough to scare a Tory out of 's senses,</l>
               <l>Who loves to see nothing in white but wenches.</l>
               <l>And thus he did begin, with hollow voice,</l>
               <l>And a shrill tone, utter'd with doleful noise.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>I am the late Renown'd Lord</hi> Russel<hi>'s Ghost,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>

                  <hi>That which will make thee;</hi> 'T was no sooner said,</l>
               <l>But strait the Restless <hi>Ghost</hi> he bravely laid.</l>
               <l>Not by th' uncertain Art of Magick Spells:</l>
               <l>Or pious cheats, us'd in Religious Cells;</l>
               <l>But the ne'r failing, sovereign Remedy</l>

               <l>St. <hi>Dunstan</hi>'s Devil, was ne'r in such a case.</l>
               <l>Thus was the Foppish, and unthinking Sot</l>
               <l>Catcht in the Noose of his own shallow Plot.</l>
               <l>Like silly witches when in great'st distress</l>

               <l>E'en so did our deluded wretched Cully</l>
               <l>Reap the Reward, of his prodigious Folly:</l>
               <l>Left by the Devil his master, and too late</l>
               <l>For him to 'scape, (O inevitable Fate!)</l>
               <l>Without sound drubbing, and a broken Pate.</l>
               <l>O Horrid Villanie, as ever can</l>
               <l>Be perpretated by perfidious man!</l>

                  <hi>Towzer,</hi> the wide mouth'd Bandog of the Nation</l>
               <l>May have new matter for his Observation,</l>
               <l>Since Tory visions, are come into fashion.</l>
               <l>The whiggish Maid of <hi>Hatfield</hi> was a cheat:</l>
               <l>'Tis this Gigantick Soul must do the feat.</l>
               <l>VVhat envious <hi>Roger,</hi> and his yelping Crew,</l>
               <l>VVanted by sence and reason to prove true,</l>
               <l>This Gallant counterfitted Ghost must do.</l>
               <l>Over the dead t' insult, and Tyranize</l>
               <l>Argues but base, unmanly cowardise.</l>

               <l>His Debt, their rancourd malice was not staid:</l>
               <l>Steep'd in the Livid <hi>Gall</hi> of raging Passion</l>
               <l>To Sacrifice his former Reputation,</l>
               <l>By shamming, cheats, and Lies upon the Nation.</l>
               <l>Thanks to kind Heavens, Defenders of the good</l>
               <l>And just, which all their curst designs withstood:</l>
